 This system is basically concerned with the railway reservation to the passengers. The need of 
this system arose because as is the known fact that India has the largest railway network in the 
whole of the world and to handle it manually is quite a tough job. By computerizing it, we will be 
able to overcome many of its limitations and will be able to make it more efficient. The handling of 
data and records for such a vast system is a very complex task if done manually but it can be made 
much easier if the system is computerized
